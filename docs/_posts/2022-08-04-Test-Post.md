## File organization

When making a new blog post, I edit the code, text and figures in an
rmarkdown file (`.rmd`). I save the `.rmd` file in the `docs` folder.

In the `.rmd` file header, I specify

    output: 
      md_document

    knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) {
          out_dir <- "_posts";
          rmarkdown::render(inputFile,
                            encoding=encoding,
                            output_dir=file.path(dirname(inputFile), out_dir))})

This ensures two things: 1. the output is a markdown file (`.md`) which
works with github pages 2. the `.md` file is saved in the `_posts`
directory folder (which is where pages looks when it is processing
posts)

To process images, all images need to be saved to the `assets` folder,
which is located within the `docs` folder. I do this with an r code
block right below the header with the following:

    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path ="/assets/")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

    summary(cars)

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](/assets/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
