## File organization

There are three important pieces to get blog posts from Rstudio to
github pages: the rmarkdown file must be located in the `docs` folder,
it must create a markdown file in the `_posts` folder and save images in
the `docs/assets` folder.

### Rmarkdown file

When making a new blog post, I edit the code, text and figures in an
rmarkdown file (`.rmd`). I save the `.rmd` file in the `docs` folder.

### Markdown file

In the `.rmd` file header, I specify

    output: 
      md_document

    knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) {
          out_dir <- "_posts";
          rmarkdown::render(inputFile,
                            encoding=encoding,
                            output_dir=file.path(dirname(inputFile), out_dir))})

This ensures two things: 1. the output is a markdown file (`.md`) which
works with github pages 2. the `.md` file is saved in the `_posts`
directory folder (which is where pages looks when it is processing
posts)

### Images

To process images, all images need to be saved to the `assets` folder,
which is located within the `docs` folder. I do this with an r code
block right below the header with the following:

    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path ="/assets/")

## Github

Commit only the `.md` and the `assets` folder (not the `.Rmd` file).
