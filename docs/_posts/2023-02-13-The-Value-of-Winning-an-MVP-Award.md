What is the value of winning the MVP award (independent of just being a
good ball player)?

First, are MVP winners actually that much better than those that
*almost* win MVP? If MVPs are in reality roughly as good as those that
almost win, maybe the 2nd place vote getters are a good counterfactual
for MVPs. That is, the 2nd place vote getters should expect the same
outcomes as the MVP winners *if* they are indeed roughly the same skill
level.

This plot shows the difference in season WAR between the MVP and the 2nd
place MVP vote getter. The names on the right side of each league panel
show the MVPs, and the names on the left show those who came in 2nd
place.
